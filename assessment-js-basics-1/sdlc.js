// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, the requirements for the software are gathered and documented. It involves understanding the needs and objectives of the software, identifying stakeholders, and defining the functional and non-functional requirements."

const design = "This is the third step, the overall structure and architecture of the software is planned. It involves creating detailed specifications, defining data models, user interfaces, and software components. Design decisions are made to ensure the software meets the requirements."

const implementation = "The fourth step involves the actual coding and development of the software. Developers write the code according to the design specifications, implementing the functionality and features as planned."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, the software is tested to ensure it functions correctly and meets the defined requirements. It involves unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing to identify and fix any defects or issues."

const maintain = "The last step involves the ongoing maintenance and support of the software after it has been deployed. It includes bug fixes, updates, enhancements, and addressing any issues or user feedback that arise during the software's lifecycle."
